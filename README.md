# Hi there, Welcome to my Profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is William. I'm a 19 year old developer based in NYC/CHI, currently double majoring in physics and math at the University of Chicago.

I specialize in automation technologies, offensive security, reverse engineering, and networking.

There's not a whole lot on my github at the current moment, but I plan on releasing a lot of open source work in the future, as well as open sourcing a few of my previous projects.

My website is dead because I forgot to pay the heroku bill, but I'm also writing on https://nullpt.rs these days.

## What I'm currently working on
- Open source reverse engineering repositories
- Bug bounties!
- Automating vulnerability scans
- Assorted other private projects

## What have I worked on?
- Shoe bots. Too many of them
- Eversify, a web3 company focused on accessible market data and information
- Wrote and scaled anti anti-bot APIs to handle thousands of requests a second
- Lots of Go networking, specifically related to http 1.1 and http 2.0
